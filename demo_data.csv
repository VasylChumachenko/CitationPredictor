A New Water-Soluble Thermosensitive Star-Like Copolymer as a Promising Carrier of the Chemotherapeutic Drug Doxorubicin ,"A new water-soluble thermosensitive star-like copolymer, dextran-graft-poly-N-iso-propilacrylamide (D-g-PNIPAM), was created and characterized by various techniques (size-exclusion chromatography, differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering (DLS) spectroscopy). The viability of cancer cell lines (human transformed cervix epithelial cells, HeLa) as a model for cancer cells was studied using MTT and Live/Dead assays after incubation with a D-g-PNIPAM copolymer as a carrier for the drug doxorubicin (Dox) as well as a D-g-PNIPAM + Dox mixture as a function of the concentration. FTIR spectroscopy clearly indicated the complex formation of Dox with the D-g-PNIPAM copolymer. The size distribution of particles in Hank’s solution was determined by the DLS technique at different temperatures. The in vitro uptake of the studied D-g-PNIPAM + Dox nanoparticles into cancer cells was demonstrated by confocal laser scanning microscopy. It was found that D-g-PNIPAM + Dox nanoparticles in contrast to Dox alone showed higher toxicity toward cancer cells. All of the aforementioned facts indicate a possibility of further preclinical studies of the water-soluble D-g-PNIPAM particles’ behavior in animal tumor models in vivo as promising carriers of anticancer agents.",3.748,4.7,49045,3,2
Cefuroxime-Loaded Hydrogels for Prevention and Treatment of Bacterial Contamination of Open Wounds,"Dextran/Sulfodextran-graft-polyacrylamide- and polyacrylamide-based hydrogels were synthesized by radical polymerization and loaded with cefuroxime to obtain antimicrobial wound dressings. Antibiotic release from the antibiotic-loaded hydrogels into an aqueous solution was studied by the HPLC-UV method. It is shown that cefuroxime-loaded Dextran/Sulfodextran-graft-polyacrylamide hydrogels release the antibiotic more slowly compared to polyacrylamide hydrogel with the same density of cross-links. Antibacterial activity of the synthesized materials was tested in vitro against wild strains of S. aureus, E. coli, and Klebsiella spp. The possibility of using the obtained antimicrobial hydrogels for the treatment of infected wounds was confirmed in vivo in a rat model.",2.973,4.6,985,2,1.33
A Novel Branched Copolymer-Containing Anticancer Drug for Targeted Therapy: In Vitro Research,"The viability of cancer cell lines (human transformed cervix epithelial cells, HeLa, and osteoblastic cell line from a C57BL/6 mouse calvaria, MC3T3, as models for cancer cells) was studied using MTT and live/dead assays after incubation with a branched copolymer dextran-graft polyacrylamide in anionic form (D-g-PAAan) as nanocarrier for drugs, doxorubicin (Dox), cisplatin (Cis), as well as their D-g-PAAan+Dox and D-g-PAAan+Cis mixtures, as a function of the concentration. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy clearly indicates the complex formation of Cis and Dox with the D-g-PAAan branched copolymer. The size distribution of particles in aqueous solution and its stability were determined by dynamic light scattering. The in vitro uptake of studied particles into cancer cells was demonstrated by confocal laser scanning microscopy. It was found that D-g-PAAan+Dox particles in contrast to Dox alone showed higher toxicity towards cancer cells. This indicates the possibility of further preclinical studies of the water-soluble D-g-PAAan+Dox particles on animal tumor models in vivo as a promising anticancer agent.",3.63,2.7,1167,3,1.67
In situformation of silver nanoparticles in linear and branched polyelectrolyte matrices using various reducing agents,"Silver nanoparticles were synthesized in linear and branched polyelectrolyte matrices using different reductants and distinct synthesis conditions. The effect of the host hydrolyzed linear polyacrylamide and star-like copolymers dextran-graft-polyacrylamide of various compactness, the nature of the reductant, and temperature were studied on in situ synthesis of silver sols. The related nanosystems were analyzed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and UV-vis absorption spectrophotometry. It was established that the internal structure of the polymer matrix as well as the nature of the reductant determines the process of the silver nanoparticle formation. Specifically, the branched polymer matrices were much more efficient than the linear ones for stable nanosystem preparation.",4.703,7.7,5555,9,3.78
SAXS combined with UV-vis spectroscopy and QELS: accurate characterization of silver sols synthesized in polymer matrices,The present work demonstrates a validation of small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) combining with ultra violet and visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy and quasi-elastic light scattering (QELS) analysis for characterization of silver sols synthesized in polymer matrices. Polymer matrix internal structure and polymer chemical nature actually controlled the sol size characteristics. It was shown that for precise analysis of nanoparticle size distribution these techniques should be used simultaneously. All applied methods were in good agreement for the characterization of size distribution of small particles (less than 60 nm) in the sols. Some deviations of the theoretical curves from the experimental ones were observed. The most probable cause is that nanoparticles were not entirely spherical in form.,4.703,7.7,5555,9,3.43
Formation of silver nanoparticles into nonionic polymer matrices of various molecular structure.,Branched copolymers dextran-polyacrylamide and linear polyacrylamide were obtained using radical polymerization method. Their molecular parameters were determined and the ability to use them as matrices for in situ synthesis of silver nanoparticles it was shown. The factors allow to obtain the stable silver colloids with narrow distribution in size were established. The temperature increasing leads to silver nanoparticles formation bigger in size and with wider polydispesity. Nanopsystem formation observes at high temperature only in branched polymer matrices.,3.08,4.6,1210,10,0
Synthesis and characterization of CdS nanoparticles obtained in star-like dextran-graft-polyacrylamide matrices,"Cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanoparticles (NPs) are synthesized into a branched dextran-graft-polyacrylamide matrix. The obtained stable sol is characterized by spectrophotometry, fluorescence spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and dynamic light scattering. The polymer affects the process of the nanoparticle formation, namely controls their size and morphology, and enhances the sols storage stability preventing the nanoparticles aggregation. It is shown that CdS NPs obtained in a branched polymer matrix are monodisperse 4–6 nm in size and form clusters (50–200 nm in size) localized in a limited macromolecule volume. The CdS nanoparticles reveal the improved blue light emission and may be considered as a promising material for light-emitting devices, especially in the blue region. They may have potential applications as biological labels.",0.86,1.2,272,6,0
